FPA Expo is designed to help you time speed and agility tests, save results, and compare to benchmarks.

## What data the app uses

### 1) Timing and results

- The app stores your test results (times) and related information (station/test name, timestamp).

### 2) Athlete profiles (optional)

- You can create athlete profiles with details such as name and optional photo.

### 3) Bluetooth (BLE) for timing gates/sensors

- If you connect compatible timing hardware, the app uses Bluetooth to connect and read sensor signals for timing.
- The app does **not** use Bluetooth to determine your location.

### 4) Photos/Camera (optional)

- If you choose to add profile photos, the app may request access to your photo library and/or camera.

### 5) Accounts (admin/staff features)

- If you use admin/staff features, the app may use your email address for authentication and account management.

## How your data is used

- To run the app features (timing, saving results, switching athletes)
- To show your history and benchmark comparisons
- To maintain account access (if you use admin/staff features)

## Your choices

- You can use most features without adding a photo.
- You can turn Bluetooth or Photos/Camera permissions on/off in your device settings.
- Uninstalling the app removes locally stored data.
